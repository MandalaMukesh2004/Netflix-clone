# Netflix-clone
# Description
This is a Netflix clone built using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the design and functionality of the Netflix landing and login pages. It includes a homepage with key features such as streaming on various devices, downloading shows for offline viewing, and creating profiles for kids. The login page allows users to sign in by entering their email and password. The website is responsive, meaning it adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.
